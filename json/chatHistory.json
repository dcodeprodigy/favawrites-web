In your response, include a suitable catchy subtitle that will cause anyone who sees this in an amazon kdp book listing to want to click on it. Make sure the subtitle follows the amazon kdp rules for subtitles as specified here Book Title\nTitles are the most frequently used search attribute. The title field should contain only the actual title of your book as it appears on your book cover. Missing or erroneous title information may bury valid results among extraneous hits. Customers pay special attention to errors in titles and won't recognize the authenticity of your book if it has corrupted special characters, superfluous words, bad formatting, extra descriptive content, etc. Examples of items that are prohibited in the title field include but aren't limited to:\n\nRepeating generic keywords like \"notebook,\" \"journal,\" \"gifts,\" \"books,\" etc.\nUnauthorized reference to other titles or authors\nUnauthorized reference to a trademarked term\nReference to sales rank (e.g., \"bestselling\")\nReference to advertisements or promotions (e.g., \"free\")\nOnly Punctuation (e.g. \"!!!!!!!!\")\nUsing only \"unknown,\" \"n/a,\" \"na,\" \"blank,\" \"none,\" \"null,\" \"not applicable\"\nHTML tags\nIf you're publishing multiple stories as one book, ensure the contents of your book are accurately reflected both in the title field and on the cover, by including terms such as \"Collection,\" \"Compilation,\" or \"Series.\" Stories that are part of a series must be in sequential order within a book and collections of individual stories must have all stories listed in the metadata.\n\nFor print books, your title must be listed on the cover (on the spine or front cover). It must also match the metadata you entered during title setup. Title information doesn't need to appear in your manuscript, but it must match the metadata if it does.\n\nNote: Ensure that thereâ€™s no language in your book title that implies your book is part of a bundled set or Boxed Set.\n\n\nSubtitle\nIf your book has a subtitle, enter it here. A subtitle is a subordinate title that contains additional information about the content of your book. Your title and subtitle together must be fewer than 200 characters. The subtitle will appear on your book's detail page, and must adhere to the same guidelines as your title.\n.\n    \n    Return your response in this schema: {\n\n    \"title\": \"The Title of the book I told you, exactly as i did\",\n\n    \"subtitle\" : \"Generate a suitable subtitle to the title and place it here.\",\n\n    \"toc\" : [\n\n        {\"ch-1\": \"the title of the first chapter\", \"sch-1\": [\"1.1 subchapter 1 title\", \"1.2 subchapter 2 title\", \"1.3 subchapter 3 title\", \"1.4 subchapter 4 title\"], \"sch-no\": \"here, input the number of sub chapters you added in this chapter strictly as a number, not a string.
