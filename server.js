Titles are the most frequently used search attribute. The title field should contain only the actual title of your book as it appears on your book cover. Missing or erroneous title information may bury valid results among extraneous hits. Customers pay special attention to errors in titles and won't recognize the authenticity of your book if it has corrupted special characters, superfluous words, bad formatting, extra descriptive content, etc. Examples of items that are prohibited in the title field include but aren't limited to:

Repeating generic keywords like "notebook," "journal," "gifts," "books," etc.
Unauthorized reference to other titles or authors
Unauthorized reference to a trademarked term
Reference to sales rank (e.g., "bestselling")
Reference to advertisements or promotions (e.g., "free")
Only Punctuation (e.g. "!!!!!!!!")
Using only "unknown," "n/a," "na," "blank," "none," "null," "not applicable"
HTML tags
If you're publishing multiple stories as one book, ensure the contents of your book are accurately reflected both in the title field and on the cover, by including terms such as "Collection," "Compilation," or "Series." Stories that are part of a series must be in sequential order within a book and collections of individual stories must have all stories listed in the metadata.

For print books, your title must be listed on the cover (on the spine or front cover). It must also match the metadata you entered during title setup. Title information doesn't need to appear in your manuscript, but it must match the metadata if it does.

Note: Ensure that thereâ€™s no language in your book title that implies your book is part of a bundled set or Boxed Set.


Subtitle
If your book has a subtitle, enter it here. A subtitle is a subordinate title that contains additional information about the content of your book. Your title and subtitle together must be fewer than 200 characters. The subtitle will appear on your book's detail page, and must adhere to the same guidelines as your title.

Follow a curious group of children who decide to uncover the mystery before Halloween night arrives. The story should be fun yet slightly eerie, with lovable characters, whimsical adventures, and a lighthearted tone. Each chapter should reveal clues that build suspense but never become too scary for young readers. You, the AI must emphasize teamwork, problem-solving, and the magic of friendship, while also leaving room for humorous, unexpected twists. 
    //     The tone of The Pumpkin Patch Mystery should be lighthearted, playful, and mildly suspenseful, with a sprinkle of whimsy and warmth. The language should be accessible and engaging for young readers, balancing curiosity with a sense of safety.
